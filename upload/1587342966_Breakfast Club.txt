Rage Rage Fuckin Rage
Can't you see baby stuck in the pain

Your stuck in a hologram, 0 1 1 0
The artist keeps painting our flames
or is it ice that keeps pouring down your veins.

Your sooo smart, Rick Sanchez
Your sooo dumb stay in your blanket
On god your just a nutcase
Oooh the irony, frozon! up in this bitch
clout chasin, heart breaking.

life, the journey,
but you don't stop and laugh because you think its a highway
Step on the weak, first prize, oops no one in the audience
I feel a rush, maybe its MJ, Clown Ass (Haha)
Its your plug and he ain't got no MJ   

Aaaah emotions, a rollacoster that kicks you in the guts, 
Your a robot so you feel kinda tickled by that,

Oooh the poor king of the dung heap, the flies worship your methane, 
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, are you still fake?

Your a human fighting your fears,BE BOLD! 
Your might mean something now!
The real ones they coming now! 
Diamonds destined to glow, you withstood the pressure
and now its time to go!

Crazy weird, (Balance), Normal boring??  
Flip a coin, how it lands, does it really matter
You are who you are, live it up g!
Go hard everyday baby!
Just don't be toxic to yourself!

My vision, love immaculate
My aim, balanced with pain
My mission, to win in this game
My goals, No retreat no surrender
